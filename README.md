# Balls

The task is to create a page with a few balls.

Each ball moves from side to side of the page at a different pace.

The pace of each ball should be chosen randomly.

On each run, each ball will have a different pace.

At any given time, the right most ball will have a background color of red, the left
most ball green, all the rest in yellow.

The page will also have an input dialog box and a “run” button. They should fade in
when the page loads.

The input box will receive the number of balls to display on the screen.

Run button – should have the UI as close to the attached image as possible (using
css, js, and icons).

Pressing the “run” button will add the defined number of balls to the screen and begin the logic from above.
Pressing the button again should not reset the balls but instead, apply the new data dynamically – Add or remove the
needed balls and apply a new pace to each ball (again, the pace is to be decided randomly).
